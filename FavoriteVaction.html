<p>My favorite place to vacation is Cancun Mexico. I've been there six times. I love the beaches there and the views. There
is so much to do from swimming w dolphins, to jet skiing along the shoreline. My family goes every year and most of the time
we invite the extended family as well. The water there is so warm. We also love going to the shops there and visiting
    places off the resort and enjoying the natural beauty.</p>
