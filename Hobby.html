    During my free time I like to trade Stocks. I have been doing this the past year and it has really been a great thing
in my life. It taught me so much about the markets as well as how to manage my money. It also had me waking up at 8 a.m.
Monday-Friday all summer long. This was soooo beneficial to my life. I had way more time to get things done than the
average high school kid. I liked to trade Equities and ETF. I am really good at trading the ETF JNUG. JNUG is a bullish
3x ETF. THis means its more volatile and moves close to that of the gold Future (/gc). THis made me most of my money
this summer.
