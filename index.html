<h2><p>My Name is Anthony, I am from Marshfield Massachusetts. I am studying finance at the University Of Maine...</p></h2>
<p>I've lived in Marshfield nealy my whole life I love it there. We are a beach town with a ton of things to do. I played
baseball and football for the high school. I love skiing and snowboarding so I am very excited to hit the slopes this winter.
During my free time I enjoy trading stocks, and watching videos related to the markets. This is my second time making a webpage.
    I made a basic webpage in 8th grade for a computer class. I thought it was pretty
    cool, however it was also very hard to understand and find errors. </p>
